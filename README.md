# Programming and Scripting Project 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the assessment project for the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the summer semester of 2023/24.


## Assessment Overview

This project is about Fisher's Iris flower dataset. 
It is a very popular dataset in data analytics particularly for learning purposes.
It's widely used in statistics, machine learning, data visualization and analysis due to its relatively small size and easy-to-understand structure.

To work on this project I had to do the research of the dataset, write a documentation and use Python code to investigate this data. 

The summary and the presentation of my analysis is submitted in Jupyter notebook *iris.ipynb* in this GitHub repository. 

The script that outputs the elements for the analysis is submitted in single python file *analysis.py* in this GitHub repository.

## Use of this project 

This project is mainly created for the assessment and educational purposes, but it can be used for further analysis. 

## Get Started

To begin, you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

**Anaconda** \
[Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) \
The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.

**Visual Studio Code** \
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com) \
The editor we will use to create Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. 

**Git** \
[Download](https://git-scm.com) \
The software we will use to track our progress.

## Data Collection and Methodology:

The iris flowers data was downloaded from [mwaskom/seaborn on Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv) and loaded to the *analysis.py* file in this repository. 

You can learn more about Iris dataset on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

I worked on this project using Python programming and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. I also reffered to multiple resourses available online. 
 
## Results:
 
 I observed very strong positive correlation (r = 0.96) between Iris petal length and petal width, suggesting that flowers with longer petals are very often wider.
