# Programming and Scripting Project 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the assignment project for the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the summer semester of 2023/24.


## Assessment Overview

This project is about Fisher's Iris flower dataset. 
It is a very popular dataset in data analytics particularly for learning purposes.
It's widely used in statistics, machine learning, data visualization and analysis due to its relatively small size and easy-to-understand structure.

To work on this project I had to do the research of the dataset, write a documentation and use Python code to investigate this data. 

The summary and the presentation of my analysis is submitted in Jupyter notebook on this GitHub repository. 


## Use of this project 

This project is mainly created for the assessment and educational purposes, but it can be used for further analysis. 

## Get Started

To begin, you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

**Anaconda** \
[Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) \
The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.

**Visual Studio Code** \
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com) \
The editor we will use to create Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks. 

**Git** \
[Download](https://git-scm.com) \
The software we will use to track our progress.
