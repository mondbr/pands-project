# Programming and Scripting Project 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the assessment project for the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the summer semester of 2023/24.


## Assessment Overview

This project is about Fisher's Iris flower dataset. 
It is a very popular dataset in data analytics particularly for learning purposes.
It's widely used in statistics, machine learning, data visualization and analysis due to its relatively small size and easy-to-understand structure.

To work on this project I had to do the research of the dataset, write a documentation and use Python code to investigate this data. 

The summary and the presentation of my analysis is submitted in Jupyter notebook *iris.ipynb* in this GitHub repository. 

The script that outputs the elements for the analysis is submitted in single python file *analysis.py* in this GitHub repository. 

#### [Open here - Python program that outputs the analysis elements - *analysis.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py)

## About Iris Dataset (History)

The *Iris flower dataset*, also known as *Fiher's Iris dataset* is a [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics) dataset popularized by British statistitian and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 publication *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*. The free access to the full article in PDF in online library can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). 

In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly.

The majority of the data was collected by [Edgar Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Anderson) to quantify the morphological variation of Iris flowers from three related species - *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*. Two of the three species were collected in the [Gasp√© Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasp%C3%A9_Peninsula) region in Canada, with all samples taken from the same pasture, picked on the same day, and measured by the same person using the same apparatus. This careful collection method ensured consistency and accuracy in the measurements.

The data contains an information of 50 samples from each of three species and its four features - the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 

The Iris data has  become a widely used tool for pattern recognition and classification tasks across various fields, including machine learning, analysis, statistics, and biology.

## Iris Dataset file

The Iris flower dataset contains a set of 150 individual records which represents three Iris spiecies:
- Iris Setosa - 50 samples
- Iris Virginica - 50 samples
- Iris Versicolor - 50 samples

The columns represents plant features such as:
- Sepal Lenght in cm
- Sepal Width in cm
- Petal Lenght in cm
- Petal Width in cm

The Iris flowers data was downloaded from [mwaskom/seaborn on Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv) and loaded to the *[analysis.py](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py)* file in this repository.

## Data Set Analysis - libraries and code
In this paragraph I will explain the necessary libraries imported that are needed for this analysis, the dataset import and the code to write a script for summary creation.

### Import libraries and modules

    # importing nessesary libraries
        import pandas as pd
        import sys
        import numpy as np 
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns

[**pandas**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp#:~:text=Pandas%20is%20a%20Python%20library,by%20Wes%20McKinney%20in%202008.) is a Python library that is used for workings with datasets. It offers a range of functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" references both "Panel Data" and "Python Data Analysis." The library was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
In this project *pandas* is used for creating a summary of the dataset from a *.csv file. 

[**sys**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, allowing interaction with the Python runtime environment. It can be used to handle command-line arguments, manage the Python interpreter, and control input and output.
In this project *sys* is used to redirect the standard output to a file instead to a terminal, as I will be writing the analysis to the text file called *[summary-analysis.txt](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-project/blob/main/summary_analysis.txt)*.

[**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) is a fundamental Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. *NumPy* is widely used in various fields such as mathematics, statistics and data science.
In this project *NumPy* is used to create a numerical arrays and analyse the correlation between numerical variables.

[**myplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) and its module [**pyplot**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html) allows to work on mathematical calculations, array manipulations, creating plots and histograms. 
In this project *matplotlib.pyplot* is used to plot varoius of histograms and plots of the Iris data variables.

[**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is another Python library built on to of Matplotlib. It is used for statistical data visualisation that helps to provide a nicely looking statistcal graphics.
In this project *seaborn* is used for plotting plots and histograms for analysis.



### Import dataset and DataFrame

To work on the summary, I needed to find the data online and load it to my program. 

The below lines of code are used for reading the raw *.csv file available online and put into a DataFrame.

A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns.

Raw file contains plain text format (Comma-Separated Values) of data that will be used for my analysis. 

    # downloading the Iris online dataset (raw file)
    df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv")

The above code loads the data into a DataFrame named *df*. This DataFrame contains all the columns that are in the CSV file. It is ready now to work on it in my analyis. 

To be able to calculate and show statistical summary of numerical columns in some of my code, I created a new DataFrame below named *num_df* from an existing DataFrame *df*. I selected specific columns **'sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'petal_length', 'petal_width'**, so my new DataFrame contains only these columns. I will need this in execution of a few Python methods in my code.

    # creating a dataframe selecting specific columns to be included in new data frame
    num_df = pd.DataFrame(df, columns=[
                            'sepal_length','sepal_width','petal_length','petal_width'])


During my work on the code in this project and project for another module, I came accross warnings being shown on my terminal. They were related to *change in the figure layout in seaborn*. With discussing this with my ATU collegues and doing research I learnt that I can use below code to simply ignore the messages being prompted. 

This can be used for a cleaner output and no-distraction especially for scripts or notebooks where warnings are not critical and do not affect the results.

However, while ignoring warnings can be helpful in certain situations, it's generally better to address warnings appropriately. Warnings often indicate potential issues in code or data. Ignoring them may hide important information that could tell diagnosing problems or improving quality of the code. 

I was reffering to the information provided on [docs.python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html). 


    # to ignore warnings regarding a change in the figure layout in seaborn
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

Now, I will explain my approach to one of the task of this project, where I need to write my summary output to the single *.txt file. Initially I wanted to use *open()* function and *write()* method, however I found it difficult to include Python built-in functions such as *describe()* or *info()* etc, because .write() function only takes string value as an input.

After further research I learnt that more useful will be using *sys.stdout()* first to re-direct the standard output to a file. 
To be able to restore it later and come back to original output I created the below reference:

I was reffering to the below sources: \
[geeksforgeeks.com](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sys-stdout-write-in-python/)\
[stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3263672/the-difference-between-sys-stdout-write-and-print)

    # saving a reference to the original standard output
    original_stdout = sys.stdout


### My functions 

To present my work in more structured way, I organised my code in this file by creating functions to break it for smaller parts for each task that are easier to work on and read.
The knowledge how to do it I learnt throughout the module. 

The list of my functions are presented as follows and they are called out at the end of the file:

- [*iris_correlation()*](#def-iris_correlation)

- [*summary_file()*](#def-summary_file)

    - [*def summary_stats()*](#def-summary_stats)

- *iris_barchart()*

- *data_hist()*

- *iris_histograms()*

- *iris_scatterplots()*

- *iris_pairplot()*

- *iris_linespace()*

- *iris_heatmap()*

### Redirecting summary to the text file

#### *def* *iris_correlation()*

My first function (although that was added later while working on the code) is *def iris_correlation():* 
I created this to assign the data into numpy arrays. I will need this later in my summary file, but also to calculate the correlation. 

References: \
Numpy arrays - ATU modules, [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-numpy-tutorial) and [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/)

    def iris_correlation():
        
    # assigning data into numpy arrays. 
        s_len = df['sepal_length'].to_numpy()
        s_wth = df['sepal_width'].to_numpy()
        p_len = df['petal_length'].to_numpy()
        p_wth = df['petal_width'].to_numpy()

        # returning the values from a function so can be called out later and assigned to variables
        return s_len, s_wth, p_len, p_wth

#### *def* *summary_file()*

This is a function that is printing the output to the text file and provide varoius information about the dataset.

I can use now *sys.stdout()* to set a default place to send a program‚Äôs text output and use print() function so all the output will be printed and saved in my dedicated .txt file. 

    # creating a variable and assign a value to it - in this case a text file
    FILENAME = 'summary_analysis.txt'

    # using the stdout to redirect the standard output to a file
    sys.stdout = open (FILENAME, 'w+t') 

In my [**analysis.py**](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-project/blob/main/analysis.py) file 
I can now use varoius of functions and methods to show summary values of the dataset:


- **print(df)** will give us an overview of the Iris dataset. We don't see the full table with entire data, but only a few rows. That does not mean we don't have that information. Rows that are out of screen are reffered as three dots. This way, we can see first five rows and last five rows of the table instead of presenting full table with entire data, but the information is still there.

We run the program:

    $ analysis.py

The program output is: 

    sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width    species
    0             5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2     setosa
    1             4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2     setosa
    2             4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2     setosa
    3             4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2     setosa
    4             5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2     setosa
    ..            ...          ...           ...          ...        ...
    145           6.7          3.0           5.2          2.3  virginica
    146           6.3          2.5           5.0          1.9  virginica
    147           6.5          3.0           5.2          2.0  virginica
    148           6.2          3.4           5.4          2.3  virginica
    149           5.9          3.0           5.1          1.8  virginica


- **print(df.describe())** will give us basic statistical values for each variable: 

The program output is: 

    sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width
    count    150.000000   150.000000    150.000000   150.000000
    mean       5.843333     3.057333      3.758000     1.199333
    std        0.828066     0.435866      1.765298     0.762238
    min        4.300000     2.000000      1.000000     0.100000
    25%        5.100000     2.800000      1.600000     0.300000
    50%        5.800000     3.000000      4.350000     1.300000
    75%        6.400000     3.300000      5.100000     1.800000
    max        7.900000     4.400000      6.900000     2.500000

Where each value states as follows:

    - count - The number of not-empty values.
    - mean - The average (mean) value.
    - std - The standard deviation.
    - min - The minimum value.
    - 25% - The 25% percentile.
    - 50% - The 50% percentile.
    - 75% - The 75% percentile.
    - max - The maximum value.

- **print(df.info())** will give us a number of samples of each type and variable type. 

The program output is: 

    RangeIndex: 150 entries, 0 to 149
    Data columns (total 5 columns):
       Column        Non-Null Count  Dtype  
    ---  ------        --------------  -----  
    0   sepal_length  150 non-null    float64
    1   sepal_width   150 non-null    float64
    2   petal_length  150 non-null    float64
    3   petal_width   150 non-null    float64
    4   species       150 non-null    object 
    dtypes: float64(4), object(1)
    memory usage: 6.0+ KB
    None



- **print(df['species'].value_counts())** will provide us with the number per selected category, in this case by spiecies. 

The program output is: 

    species
    setosa        50
    versicolor    50
    virginica     50
    Name: count, dtype: int64


I also wanted to get more detailed statistical analysis, for example to display summary for each variable individually. To do this, I decided to create another function, inside the current one, as the same action will be applied to 4 variables. 

##### *def* *summary_stats()*

The code: 

    # Iterate over each variable name
        for var in var_names:

            # using describe() module get the basic statistic for variables
            summary = data[var].describe()
    
            # Extracting mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum from the summary statistics above
            mean = summary['mean']
            std_dev = summary['std']
            minimum = summary['min']
            maximum = summary['max']

I started with a *for* loop that go over each element in the list 'var names'. Each element represents a variable name from the DataFrame. 
Then, for each variable name in 'var_names' the 'describe()' method generates a summary statistic for the variable. 
Next, I extracted specific statistics from the summary: mean, standard deviation, min value and max value. 

- **print(f'{summary_stats(df,variables)}')**

After creating listo of variable names, and printing out the function created above using *print(f'{summary_stats(df,variables)}')*, the output is as follows:

    Summary statistics for sepal_length:
    --------------------------------------
    Mean:  5.843333333333334
    Standard Deviation:  0.8280661279778629
    Minimum:  4.3
    Maximum:  7.9

    Summary statistics for sepal_width:
    --------------------------------------
    Mean:  3.0573333333333337
    Standard Deviation:  0.435866284936698
    Minimum:  2.0
    Maximum:  4.4

    Summary statistics for petal_length:
    --------------------------------------
    Mean:  3.7580000000000005
    Standard Deviation:  1.7652982332594667 
    Minimum:  1.0
    Maximum:  6.9

    Summary statistics for petal_width:
    --------------------------------------
    Mean:  1.1993333333333336
    Standard Deviation:  0.7622376689603465
    Minimum:  0.1
    Maximum:  2.5

- **print(average_val)**

Then I wanted to see the the average value for each variable for each species. After grouping DataFrame df by the 'spiecies' I calculated the mean of each numerical column for each species group.
I was reffering to information available on [pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)

The output is:

    Average value for each variable for each species (cm):
    =============================================================
        sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width

- **print(num_df.var()), print(num_df.corr()), print(num_df.cov())**

I was looking for the informaton how I can print other statistical values such as variance, correlation and covariance. By following the below links I was able to present this information in a Matrix of values:

[pandas.DataFrame.var](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.var.html)
[pandas.DataFrame.cov](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.cov.html)
[pandas.DataFrame.corr](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html)

As the default value of *numeric_only* is false, that is why I was getting error while I was using my original DataFrame *df*, since there are string variables (spiecies). 
To fix that problem I decided to create a new DataFrame *num_df* as mentioned in one of the paragraph before, with only numeric variables. However, just adding a condition to original DataFrame *(df.var(numeric_only=True))* would give me the same result. For my educational purposes I decided to keep those two options for future reference. 

The output is:

- **nan_values = df.isna()**

With having a small experience already with working on another project for ATU assessment, I came across the situation where I could not work on some analysis where I have NaN (no data) values in my data set. 
I decided then to check if there are any NaN values in this dataset just in case that this my impact my correlation analysis I wanted to do later on:
To check that I ran a script checking the NaN values in dataset, count them and print the output depending on the number of NaN values using *if* statement. If the number would be more than 0, that would mean there are some NaN values and I would need to do additional manipulation on dataset to clear/ignore NaN values. 

I learnt about this from similar analysis done by *Sunil Kumar Dash* on [analyticsvidhya.com](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/04/data-exploration-and-visualisation-using-palmer-penguins-dataset/). More information of how to delete the NaN data I found on [www.medium.com](https://medium.com/@TheDataScience-ProF/nan-removal-with-python-3d97b954d16d#:~:text=Removing%20NaN%20values%20from%20a%20list%20in%20Python%20can%20be,remove%20them%20from%20a%20list.)
and [*ashbabkhan12*](https://ashbabkhan12.medium.com/how-to-remove-nan-values-in-data-using-python-8f959e3d5fbc) blog. 


The output of this script is:

    Number of NaN (no data) values
    =============================================================
    NaN values per column:
    sepal_length    0
    sepal_width     0
    petal_length    0
    petal_width     0
    species         0
    dtype: int64

    Total NaN values:0
    There is no NaN values in this dataset! We can now do the analysis : )


- **print(corr)**

This is another way to check the correlation, this time in numpy array. We were discussing this during the ATU modules. 
I decided to keep this in my summary_analysis.txt file as I will need that later in my data visualisation. 
I called a function iris_correlation and assigned four numerical variables that I will neeed. It will return four arrays corresponding to different measurements (such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) from the iris dataset.

Then, by using np.corrcoef() function from the NumPy library I calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between variables to find the relationship between the variables. 

The code is: 

    # checking the correlation
        # assigning arrays from iris_correlation() funkction to its corresponding variable so we can use it
        s_len, s_wth, p_len, p_wth = iris_correlation()

        # i learnt about the correlation in python in a ATU module 'Principles in Data Analytics 23/24'
        corr = np.corrcoef([s_len, s_wth, p_len, p_wth])

        # writing to the text file the output of the correlation array
        print('Correlation array')
        print('=============================================================')
        print(corr)
        print ('\n\n')

The output is:

    Correlation array
    =============================================================
    [[ 1.         -0.11756978  0.87175378  0.81794113]
    [-0.11756978  1.         -0.4284401  -0.36612593]
    [ 0.87175378 -0.4284401   1.          0.96286543]
    [ 0.81794113 -0.36612593  0.96286543  1.        ]]

By the above we can tell that the strongest positive correlation is 0.96 between petal lenght (3rd) and petal width (4th). 

#### Summary

In the above code I presented a numerous examples of how to show the summary of the Iris Dataset. I have not only practised of how to work on the dataset, but also how to re-direct the input to be presented in a text file with a good looking, readable format. To tell the user, that the file is finished, I added a simple print **END** in the text file.

### Data visualisation and plots

After working on some text descriptions and summaries, in this section I will present my work on visualising the dataset in a barchart, histograms, pairplots scatterplot and heatmap. 
For each of the type I created a separate function that will create a plot, show it to the user and save in the repository as a *.png file. 

#### Barchart and Histograms

Firstly, I wanted to present a bar chart for Iris dataset with a function def iris_barchart():

## Results:
 
 I observed very strong positive correlation (r = 0.96) between Iris petal length and petal width, suggesting that flowers with longer petals are very often wider.
