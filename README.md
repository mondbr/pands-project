# Programming and Scripting Project 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the assignment project for the Programming and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the summer semester of 2023/24.


## Assessment Overview

This project is about Fisher's Iris flower dataset. 
It is a very popular dataset in data analytics particularly for learning purposes.
It's widely used in statistics, machine learning, data visualization and analysis due to its relatively small size and easy-to-understand structure.

## Use of this project 

This project is mainly created for the assessment and educational purposes, but it can be used for further analysis.
