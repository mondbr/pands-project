    "The *Iris flower dataset*, also known as *Fiher's Iris dataset* is a [multivariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics) dataset popularized by British statistitian and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 publication *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*. The free access to the full article in PDF in online library can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the data was collected by [Edgar Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Anderson) to quantify the morphological variation of Iris flowers from three related species - *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*. Two of the three species were collected in the [Gasp√© Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasp%C3%A9_Peninsula) region in Canada, with all samples taken from the same pasture, picked on the same day, and measured by the same person using the same apparatus. This careful collection method ensured consistency and accuracy in the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains an information of 50 samples from each of three species and its four features - the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Iris data has  become a widely used tool for pattern recognition and classification tasks across various fields, including machine learning, analysis, statistics, and biology.\n",
